NAME
    Slash::OurNet - Web Interface for OurNet::BBS

SYNOPSIS
    (Currently, this project exists mainly for historical/archival purposes,
    not for active development.)

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a web interface to telnet-based BBS systems as well
    as NNTP servers, either as a Slash plugin or as a stand-alone CGI daemon
    in ournet.pl included with this distribution.

    To install this module, either copy the whole distribution under the
    plugins/ directory before installing Slash, or use the standard perl
    module install process:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make install

    and then use the bin/install-plugin utility (usually located in
    /usr/local/slash/bin/) to install it as a feature of your site.

    Please remember to change the "ournet.conf" settings to suit the
    specific configurations of your "bbscomd" daemon. See related
    documentations in OurNet::BBS for an overview.
